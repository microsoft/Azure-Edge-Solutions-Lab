# 1. Prerequisites
For this E2E reference solution you would need the following prerequisites:
* 2 - node cluster [Deploy a 2-node cluster on AzSHCI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/hci/deploy/create-cluster?tabs=use-network-atc-to-deploy-and-manage-networking-recommended)
* [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free)
* [Windows Admin Center](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/contact/azure-stack-hci/) 

# 2. Preparing AzSHCI - 2 node cluster
Follow the Microsoft Learn documentation to set up Windows Admin Center (WAC)
[QuickStart setup AzSHCI with WAC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/hci/get-started)

Follow the Microsoft Learn documents to configure your two-node cluster:
[Deploy a 2-node cluster on AzSHCI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/hci/deploy/create-cluster?tabs=use-network-atc-to-deploy-and-manage-networking-recommended)

# 3. Configuring ARC and AKS on AzSHCI
When setting up AKS you will perform the steps to initially set up the AKS Management cluster and reserve IPs for all the Worker Clusters, then you will proceed to step below _Creating AI Workload AKS Cluster_. Work with your networking engineers to reserve a block of IP addresses and ensure you have vSwitch created. Gateway and DNS Servers can be found by looking at setting of the vSwitch in WAC. Below is an example when configuring with Static IP. 
## Here is the Engineering Plan used for our E2E Lab:

1. Prepare the 2-node cluster by installing AKS, follow this [PowerShell QuickStart Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/hybrid/kubernetes-walkthrough-powershell)
2. Alternatively, you could setup with WAC. The demo was created with Static-IPs from the above Engineering plan. [AKS using WAC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/hybrid/setup). Aside form Engineering plan above all other options were left default We did not use VLANs. We worked with our IT Admin to block out 20 sub IP addresses and found the networking information on each node in the HCI cluster, in WAC under the virtual switch tool. Alternatively you can work with your IT Admin to build your Engineering Plan. 


# 4. Creating AI Workload AKS Cluster
Now you have AKS and ARC installed in your management cluster. You need to create a AI Workload cluster and prime the nodes to leverage the AI Accelerator hardware. 
## Create AI Workload Cluster
Follow [instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/hybrid/create-kubernetes-cluster) to create a cluster named: AI Workload
We stood up a 3 node AKS cluster.

## Accessing via ARC
[Set up your service account token.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/cluster-connect?tabs=azure-cli#service-account-token-authentication-option)

## Create a GPU Pool and attach GPUs to AI Workload Nodes
Once your AI Workload cluster is created, go to WAC Cluster Manager, and look at VM list. Take note of VM names for the AI Workload.

Follow [these steps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/hci/manage/use-gpu-with-clustered-vm) to create a GPU Pool in WAC and assign the VMs from the AI Workload Cluster. 

## Preparing node for AI workload
Now that we have the GPUs assigned, we need to install Docker and the Nvidia plug-in. 

1.Go to Docker page and find your respective binary. For this example, we use x86_64 docker-20.10.9.tgz.
[Docker binaries](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/binaries/#install-static-binaries)

2. Get the Workload AI node IP address and connect using your rsa. When using WAC, these will be placed in your Cluster storage under volumes then AksHCI. You can run this from your dev machine command prompt, but ensure you are in the same folder as the rsa file. For command below we copied out the rsa file to dev machine and renamed to _akshci_rsa.xml_. Learn more at [Connect with SSH to Linux or Windows worker nodes, we are using Linux nodes]([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/hybrid/ssh-connection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/hybrid/ssh-connection#use-ssh-to-connect-to-linux-worker-nodes)
```shell
ssh -i "C:\Users\Susan.Seiler\Documents\akshci_rsa.xml" clouduser@<IP Address of the Node>

ssh -i $env:SYSTEMDRIVE\AksHci\.ssh\akshci_rsa clouduser@<IP Address of the Node>
	
ssh -i akshci_rsa.xml clouduser@<IP Address of the Node>
```

3. Once on the Workload AI node, download the docker binary.
```bash
sudo curl https://download.docker.com/linux/static/stable/x86_64/docker-20.10.9.tgz -o docker-20.10.9.tgz
```

4. Inflate docker binaries.
```bash
sudo tar xzvf docker-20.10.9.tgz
```

5. Remove any running files.
```bash
sudo rm -rf '/usr/bin/containerd' 
sudo rm -rf '/usr/bin/containerd-shim-runc-v2'
``` 
	
6. Copy the binaries to your clouduser location. 
```bash
sudo cp docker/* /usr/bin/ 
```

7. Run docker in background.
```bash
sudo dockerd & 
```

You should see the API listening once started, refrence image below.

8. Installing the Nvidia GPU plugin. Go to Nvidia page for full set of instructions. 
[GitHub - NVIDIA/k8s-device-plugin: NVIDIA device plugin for Kubernetes](https://github.com/NVIDIA/k8s-device-plugin#preparing-your-gpu-nodes)

9. Update docker as default runtime by createing daemon.json
```bash
sudo nano /etc/docker/daemon.json
```

10. Paste into newly created daemon.json file
```json
{
    "default-runtime": "nvidia",
     "runtimes": {
         "nvidia": {
             "path": "/usr/bin/nvidia-container-runtime",
             "runtimeArgs": []
         }
     }
}
```

11. Ceck to ensure changes took.
```bash
sudo cat /etc/docker/daemon.json
```
	
12. Remove running files and restart docker
```bash
sudo rm /var/run/docker.pid 
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/docker/volumes/*
sudo dockerd &
```


12. Configure containerd. Open the config.toml file and paste in modification from step 13.
```bash
sudo nano /etc/containerd/config.toml
```

13. Paste into file
```yaml
version = 2
[plugins]
  [plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri"]
    [plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri".containerd]
      default_runtime_name = "nvidia"

      [plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri".containerd.runtimes]
        [plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri".containerd.runtimes.nvidia]
          privileged_without_host_devices = false
          runtime_engine = ""
          runtime_root = ""
          runtime_type = "io.containerd.runc.v2"
          [plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri".containerd.runtimes.nvidia.options]
            BinaryName = "/usr/bin/nvidia-container-runtime"
```
14. Check to ensure changes took.
```bash
sudo cat /etc/containerd/config.toml
```

15. Restart containerd
```bash
sudo systemctl restart containerd
```

16. Optional troubleshooting:
```bash
sudo systemctl stop containerd
sudo systemctl start containerd
sudo containerd
``` 
	
17. From powershell in the kubectl command line. Enabeling GPU supporting in k8. 

Run deployment
```bash
kubectl apply -f edge-ai1.yaml
```
Run nvidia plugin
```bash
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA/k8s-device-plugin/v0.12.3/nvidia-device-plugin.yml 
```
	

# 5. Integrating with GitHub

In this section you will configure GitOps. GitOps is an operational framework for Kubernetes cluster management and application delivery. GitOps applies development practices like version control, collaboration, compliance, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) to infrastructure automation. Further reading can be found on the Microsoft Docs page:[QuickStart](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/conceptual-gitops-flux2) to configure your ARC enabled AKS cluster with GitHub using Flux.

Remember to have the Kubernetes default namespace identified in your deployment yaml.


1. Go to your K8s cluster on the Azure Portal. On the left column select `GitOps` under `Settings`, then click `Create`. This will initiate the GitOps configuration creation process.
2. On the `Basics` tab give the configuration a name under `Configuration name`. For `Namespace` use `contoso` as that is what we have used in all the files provided in this repository. The `scope` is `Namespace`. Leave everthing else unchanged and click `Next`.
3. On the `Source` tab enter the GitHub `Repository URL` that you want to configure. Specify the `Reference Type` as `Branch` and for `Branch` add the branch name to monitor. Specify the `Repository type` as either `Private` or `Public` depending on your GitHub repository. Under `Sync configuration` change `Sync interval (minutes)` to `1`. Now click `Next`.
4. On the `Kustomization` tab click `+ Create`, this will open a section on the right. Give your kustomization a name under `Instance name`. For `Path`, add the complete path location to the YAML configuration, for example `./contoso-app/yaml-file`. Enable `Prune`. Leave everything else unchanged and click `Save`, then click `Next`.
5. On the `Review + create` tab, verify all fields are as mentioned, then click `Create`. In a few moments the GitOps configuration will be created.
6. Once the GitOps configuration is successfully created you can make changes to the YAML file and verify that this triggers a new deployment, old pods are stopped and new ones are created depending on the changes that were made.
